# Multiple Computer Vision Projects

These projects were the individual homework when I studied Computer Vision at UMass Amherst.

# Introduction

These projects cover three aspects of computer vision.

The first part covers topics on physics and geometry:
 - Radiometry
 - Light and color
 - Image formation and cameras

The second part covers topics of modeling and processing natural images:
 - Optical flow and depth from parallax
 - Linear filtering and convolutions
 - Modeling natural images and applications (e.g., image de-noising and texture synthesis)
 - Image alignment and matching

The last part looks into topics related to data and machine learning for extracting information from images that include:
 - Machine learning: linear models, nearest neighbors, decision trees, deep networks, etc.
 - Learning and transfer learning with deep networks


# Getting Started
There are report and code scripts in each project folder. The report contains requirements and my solutions, while the code scripts are my implementation processes. The projects are completed by using Python and MATLAB. As the homework is not allowed to use advanced libraries, most of the algorithms are implemented manually.  

## Prerequisites

Python3+  
> Packages: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc. 

MATLAB
